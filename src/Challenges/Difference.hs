module Challenges.Difference where

-- Your goal in this kata is to implement
-- a difference function, which subtracts
-- one list from another and returns the result.
-- It should remove all values from list a,
-- which are present in list b keeping their order.
-- difference [1,2] [1] == [2]
-- If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences
-- must be removed from the other:
-- difference [1,2,2,2,3] [2] == [1,3]
--
difference :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
difference a b = filter (`notElem` b) a
--
-- $> difference [1,2,4,3,3,1] [1,3]
